This is a 2 year position with possibility to extend for a 3rd year. Interested applicant please see our posting on <a href="https://jobrxiv.org/job/center-for-genetic-epidemiology-university-of-southern-california-27778-nih-t32-funded-postdoctoral-fellow-in-population-genetics-and-genetic-epidemiology/" target="_blank">jobRxiv</a> and reach out to <b>Charleston</b> for more details!</p> -->
				  <p><b><i>10.2020</i></b>: <b>Minhui</b> published a new <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.317552v1" target="_blank">preprint</a> on frequency differentiation of height-associated SNPs among global continental populations. In this manuscript we showed that by using height-associated SNPs ascertained from biobank GWAS we can be protected from any confounding due to residual stratification in GWAS summary statistics. We found that these height-associated SNPs exhibit significantly higher level of differentiation among African, European, and East Asian populations, consistent with a signature of polygenic adaptation. Any question or comment are welcomed!</p>
				  <p><b><i>9.2020</i></b>: The consortium paper on trans-ethnic GWAS of blood cell traits in >700,000 individuals is out in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420308229" target="_blank">Cell!</a>. It was a fun collaboration where we contributed population genetic analyses to demonstrate the power of GWAS in diverse populations.</p>
				  <p><b><i>9.2020</i></b>: <b>Camellia</b> was awarded the 2020 Provost Fellowship to conduct research in the lab for this school year. Congrats Camellia!</p>
				  <p><b><i>7.2020</i></b>: <b>Soyoung</b> gave a lightning talk on her multi-ethnic GWAS on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the International Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) 2020 annual meeting. Her <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asGjk34tnrNyyIGfNnUE8itV2FgEtUAV/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">lightning talk</a> and poster won one of the three <a href="https://twitter.com/genepisociety/status/1279432733798924288?s=20" target="_blank">Best Poster Awards</a>.

                                    <p>The overarching theme of our research group is to <b>use genetic approaches to understand how evolutionary forces shaped the genetic architecture of complex traits within and between populations</b>. To this end, we have been involved in a number of past and ongoing medical genetics studies in mapping genetic loci underlying human complex traits. We are also continually interested in investigating the evolutionary forces, namely demography and selection, that shaped the pattern of genetic variability and phenotypic distribution. We are particularly interested in diverse, global human populations and our successes result from collaborating with innovative colleagues and thriving in resourceful consortiums.
