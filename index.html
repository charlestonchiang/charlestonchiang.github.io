To this end, we have been involved in a number of past and ongoing medical genetics studies in mapping genetic loci underlying human complex traits. We are also continually interested in investigating the evolutionary forces, namely demography and selection, that shaped the pattern of genetic variability and phenotypic distribution. We are particularly interested in diverse, global human populations and our successes result from collaborating with innovative colleagues and thriving in resourceful consortiums.

				<!--	    <li><p><b>Meng (Lemon) Lin</b> is a postdoctoral scholar in the group. She is interested in characterizing the genetic architecture of human complex traits. She is particularly interested in understanding component of architecture due to the non-additive or rare variations, and the interactions of evolutionary histories of diverse population and pattern of variation. Before joining the group, she received her PhD from SUNY Stony Brook working with <a href="http://hennlab.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Brenna Henn</a>, where her work focused on the genetic landscape and evolution of skin pigmentation and height of the indigenous and admixed southern African population. Motivated by her former training, she is extending her interest to investigate the demographic history and population structure of Native Hawaiians, and how these insights can be leveraged for trait mapping empirically. She is also investigating the dominance components behind various clinical and anthropometric traits in a large Finnish cohort.</p>

<!--				  <p><b>Postdoctoral Fellows through USC-Taiwan Postdoctoral Scholar Program:</b> Candidates are eligible if they received their Ph.D. no earlier than July 20, 2015 and no later than July 19, 2018. The degree must come from a Taiwanese institution, but Taiwanese nationals who have received degrees elsewhere are also eligible. The salary for postdoctoral fellow is $68,000 per year minus the cost of the benefits package. Fellow is expected to reside in the Los Angeles area during the academic year. More information on the program can be found <a href="https://postdocs.usc.edu/taiwan-usc-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/" target="_blank">here</a>. Online application is <a href="https://postdocs.usc.edu/taiwan-usc-application/" target="_blank">here</a>. Applications are accepted between June 11, 2018 and July 19, 2018.</p>
				  <p>Informal inquiries should be emailed to Charleston Chiang, particularly if you would like to work together to develop a proposal for the application. An ideal candidate should have a recent Ph.D. in biology, genetics, computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, or a related field. Proficiency in one or more programming languages (e.g. python, perl, C++, R, etc.) and in Unix-based computing environments is essential. Competitive applicants will also have extensive experience in conducting human genetics research and in analyzing large genetic datasets. Applicants can develop projects within the scope of the <a href="research.html" target="_blank">ongoing efforts</a> in the research group, but will be encouraged to take advantage of the active collaboration with Taiwanese Biobank</p>
