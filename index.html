                                    <p>The overarching theme of our research group is to <b>use genetic approaches to understand how evolutionary forces shaped the genetic architecture of complex traits within and between populations</b>. To this end, we have been involved in a number of past and ongoing medical genetics studies in mapping genetic loci underlying human complex traits. We are also continually interested in investigating the evolutionary forces, namely demography and selection, that shaped the pattern of genetic variability and phenotypic distribution. We are particularly interested in diverse, global human populations and our successes result from collaborating with innovative colleagues and thriving in resourceful consortiums.
