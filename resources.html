					  <h3>Resources</h3>
					  <p>Welcome to the Chiang Lab! We are so glad you are interested in our research and have joined our team. Consistent with the interdisciplinary research going on in lab and an emphasis on training, students and other members of the lab came from different backgrounds, with different levels of preparedness and expertise. Therefore this page is meant to provide quick resources and guidelines that will hopefully build a strong and cohesive lab culture that is respectful, friendly, and productive.</p></br></br>
					  
					<!-- Lab Expectations -->
					  <h4>Lab Expectations</h4>
					  <p><b>Safety First</b>: your health and well-being, both mentally and physically, are more important than your research. Therefore all building safety codes and access regulations should be closely adhered. Although we are a computational lab, we are situated closely to, and on occasions interact with, wet lab space, safety codes in the wet lab should also be followed.</p></br>
					  <p><b>Harassment-free Environment</b>: it is essential to create an inclusive and welcoming work environment. We are all united because we are fascinated by the specific aspects of science, which clearly do not exclude based on attributes such as race, citizenship, religion, political affiliations, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability status, pregnancy, physical appearance or body size, etc. Therefore, <u>any harassment or discrimination of anyone, based on any of the above protected characteristics and more, will not be tolerated</u>.
					  <ul><ul>
					    <li>For more information, see <a href="https://policy.usc.edu/discrimination/" target="_blank">https://policy.usc.edu/discrimination/</a></li>
					    <li>Confidential on-campus resources: <a href="https://employees.usc.edu/work-family-life/" target="_blank">Center for Work and Family Life</a> and <a href="https://studenthealth.usc.edu/sexual-assault/" target="_blank">USC Student Health</a> (Title IX will make every effort to keep complaints confidential, but not guaranteed).</li>
					    <li><b>Workplace Hostility and Microaggression</b>: while the law does not require us to be polite, we should be held to a higher standard than legal definition to ensure an inclusive and productive environment. Every member of the lab is expected to be respectful and professional at all times to others and others' work. Microaggression is particularly difficult to avoid, because it is rooted in implicit biases that we all have. See this <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/microaggressions-in-everyday-life/201011/microaggressions-more-just-race" target="_blank">link</a> for some examples so you are more aware how unintentional, or even well-intentioned, actions could be perceived differently by others</li>
					  </ul></ul>
					  </p>
					
					  <p><b>Flexible Hours</b>: one of the many perks of an academic life is the flexibility of our work schedule. All members of the lab are expected to be self-motivated and that I hope I would never have to question the efforts one put into their research. Everyone has a different lifestyle, different needs for work-life balance, and different working habits that will make them most productive. However, science also does not happen in a vaccuum. We all benefit from interacting with each other, throwing ideas off each other, and leveraging our experience to enable the success of those less experienced (in fact, that is a lot of what PIs do!). In general, every member of the team (particularly members who are not bound by class schedules anymore) should be <u>actively performing their work duties between 11am to 3pm on weekdays</u>, so that each of us will be able to overlap for a significant chunk of the workday while accommodating for individual schedules. (This is not to say you should only work 4 hours a day! And obviously, exceptions apply) Your consistent presence during those times will lead to interactions and team-building, for the benefits of you and your labmates.</p></br>

					  <p><b>Emails</b>: due to my own working style and work-life balance, I may be sending you emails outside of what is considered "regular" working hours. I do not expect a response from you outside of your typical working schedule. Though there may be occasional exceptions if we are working close to a deadline. In those instances, I will let you know ahead of time the possibility of breaking this expectation.</p></br>
					  <p><b>Participations at lab meetings and seminars</b>: each member of the lab is expected to participate in the weekly lab meeting. The expectation is not merely the physical presence at lab meetings, but the active thinking and constructive critiques that you will be providing. Current lab meeting format is a rotational schedule where one member is responsible for leading lab meeting each week. The presenter will have a choice of presenting research update or lead a journal club. You can check with me if you need advice for a journal club paper or are unsure about your choices. Everyone is also expected to regularly attend the Center for Genetic Epidemiology seminars and journal club</p></br>

<p><b>Funding, fellowships, and travel grants</b>: everyone is strongly encouraged to search for, identify, and apply for funding. These funds will greatly enhance your ability to attend conferences, network, broadening your expertise, and improve your candidacy for job opportunities after leaving the lab. I will do my best to advise on these applications and make the application competitive to the best of my ability</p></br>

					<!-- Students' expectation of Me -->	
					  <h4>Student and Postdoc's expectation of the PI</h4>
<p>In addition to all of the above expectations that apply to every member of the lab, there are additional expectations that students and postdocs can have of the PI</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can expect regular one-on-one meetings with me to update on research progress and to plan the next steps. Generally you can plan for an hour of one-on-one meeting each week, and can always email me to request more time.</li>
  <li>You can expect that I will assist with brainstorming, writing, and improving postdoc or graduate fellowship applications, travel grants, or other grant applications.</li>
  <li>You can expect that I will proof-read and contribute significantly to the writing of any abstracts and manuscripts stemming from your research in lab.</li>
  <li>You can expect an opportunity to practice, possibly more than once, any talk you will be presenting at conferences or other venues. I will also be happy to provide feedbacks on structure and content of the slides prior to the practice talk.</li>
  <li>You can expect to discuss with me about your future career goals, and tailor the training plans according to these career goals</li>
</ul>

					  <h4>Tutorials for budding genome scientists</h4>
					  <p><a href="http://sergheimangul.com" target="_blank">Serghei Mangul</a>, a faculty at the School of Pharmacy, has a great <a href="https://github.com/QCB-Collaboratory/W1.UNIX.command.line/wiki" target="_blank">UNIX tutorial</a> if you are not familiar with the UNIX environment. Please familiarize yourself with this first, but you can ignore the last bit on using high performance computing cluster (HPCC), which uses UCLA's hoffman cluster</p>
					  <p>For an introduction to USC's own HPCC system, please follow the tutorial that Minhui has put together, linked <a href="doc/slide.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
